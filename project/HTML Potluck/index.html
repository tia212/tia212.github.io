    <h5>Step1</h5>
<P>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add ground beef 
        and onion. Cook, while crumbling with a spoon and stirring often 
        until browned. Add taco seasoning and water and cook until slightly 
        thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. 
    <h5>Step2</h5> 
        Line the bottom of a deep air fryer basket with parchment paper and allow 
        the parchment to come up the sides. Arrange a layer of chips along the 
        bottom. Top with half of the beef mixture and sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese 
        on top. Spoon green chiles over cheese and top with a second layer of chips. 
        Sprinkle half of the beans evenly over the chips and top with salsa and the 
        second third of the cheese. Arrange the last layer of chips over the cheese 
        and top with remaining beans. Add sliced jalapenos, remaining  
        cheese and olives. 
        <h5>Step3</h5>
        Set air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and cook until the 
        cheese is melted and begins to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  
        <h5>Step4</h5>
        Using the parchment paper, carefully lift the nachos from the air fryer 
        basket onto a serving platter. Top with sour cream, avocado, tomato,
        cilantro, and any additional toppings if desired. Serve immediately.

        <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
        
        <li>12 cups	day-old challah, brioche or other egg bread diced 
            nto 1-inch cubes</li>

        <li>1/4 cup	parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <h3>Season
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                Preheat the oven to 425°F. Season the inside of the 
                chicken cavity with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon 
                black pepper. Stuff the cavity with the fresh herbs and 
                the garlic. Rub the outside of the chicken with 4 tablespoons 
                of the butter and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning,
                1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Tuck the wing 
                tips under the body of the chicken to keep from burning. 
                Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan. Add 1/3 cup 
                chicken stock to the pan.

                <h3>Roast</h3>
                <h4>Step2</h4>
                
                Roast for 15 minutes at 425°F, then reduce the heat to 350°F. 
                Continue roasting the chicken, basting every 20 minutes, until 
                the juices run clear, the legs move easily when wiggled and a 
                meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh 
                registers 170°F. This will take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours for a 
                5-to-7-pound PERDUE® OVEN STUFFER® Whole Chicken.

                <h3>Sauté</h3>
                <h4>Step3</h4>
                
                Melt 1 stick of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Add the leeks and celery and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 
                the apples and the apple cider and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes 
                until the apples start to soften. Stir in the remaining poultry 
                seasoning and remove from heat.

                <h3>Bake</h3>
                <h4>Step4</h4>

                n a large bowl, combine the challah cubes, the sautéed apple 
                mixture, the toasted walnuts and the parsley. Add enough 
                chicken stock to make a very moist mixture. Mix well to 
                combine. Transfer the mixture to a 9” x 11” baking dish. 
                Bake in a 350°F oven for the last 45 minutes of chicken 
                roasting time. Remove the chicken and stuffing from the oven.
                Let the chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. 
                While the chicken rests, set the table and finish your side 
                dishes. Carve your chicken, serve with stuffing and enjoy 
                your holiday!

                TIP: For a fun presentation, make individual stuffing cups. 
                Stuff jumbo muffin liners with stuffing and bake for 45 
                minutes. If you don’t have stale bread, spread out the bread 
                cubes on a baking sheet and dry in a 300°F oven for 15 to 
                20 minutes.

        <h1>Ingredients
        </h1>
        <ul>
           <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning, or seasoning blend of choice</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>

            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

            <li>> tablespoons olive oil</li>

            <li>8 garlic cloves, or more as needed, peeled and smashed, 
                about 1/4 cup lightly packed</li>

            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed (optional)</li>
            </ul>       
<h1>Directions
</h1>
<p>
    <h5>Step1</h5>
    Combine herb seasoning, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, and 
    flour in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag and mix well.
    <h5>Step2</h5>
    Combine butter and olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over 
    medium heat. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels, place in 
    the bag of seasoned flour, seal, and toss chicken thighs in the flour 
    mixture until evenly coated.
    <h5>Step3</h5>
    When butter stops sizzling, add chicken pieces and cook until 
    nicely browned, no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 
    4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near 
    the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a 
    plate and keep warm.
    <h5>Step4</h5>
    Add smashed garlic to the same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low 
    and cook garlic, stirring frequently, just until fragrant, no 
    longer than 1 minute.
    <h6>Step6</h5>
        Sample garlic cream sauce and adjust seasoning, if necessary. 
        Return chicken to the skillet and stir in any accumulated juices. 
        Allow chicken to heat through. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.
