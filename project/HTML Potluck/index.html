<h5>Step1</h5>
<P>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add ground beef 
        and onion. Cook, while crumbling with a spoon and stirring often 
        until browned. Add taco seasoning and water and cook until slightly 
        thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. 
<h5>Step2</h5> 
        Line the bottom of a deep air fryer basket with parchment paper and allow 
        the parchment to come up the sides. Arrange a layer of chips along the 
        bottom. Top with half of the beef mixture and sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese 
        on top. Spoon green chiles over cheese and top with a second layer of chips. 
        Sprinkle half of the beans evenly over the chips and top with salsa and the 
        second third of the cheese. Arrange the last layer of chips over the cheese 
        and top with remaining beans. Add sliced jalapenos, remaining  
        cheese and olives. 
<h5>Step3</h5>
        Set air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and cook until the 
        cheese is melted and begins to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  
<h5>Step4</h5>
        Using the parchment paper, carefully lift the nachos from the air fryer 
        basket onto a serving platter. Top with sour cream, avocado, tomato,
        cilantro, and any additional toppings if desired. Serve immediately.
