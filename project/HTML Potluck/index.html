    <h5>Step1</h5>
<P>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add ground beef 
        and onion. Cook, while crumbling with a spoon and stirring often 
        until browned. Add taco seasoning and water and cook until slightly 
        thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. 
    <h5>Step2</h5> 
        Line the bottom of a deep air fryer basket with parchment paper and allow 
        the parchment to come up the sides. Arrange a layer of chips along the 
        bottom. Top with half of the beef mixture and sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese 
        on top. Spoon green chiles over cheese and top with a second layer of chips. 
        Sprinkle half of the beans evenly over the chips and top with salsa and the 
        second third of the cheese. Arrange the last layer of chips over the cheese 
        and top with remaining beans. Add sliced jalapenos, remaining  
        cheese and olives. 
        <h5>Step3</h5>
        Set air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and cook until the 
        cheese is melted and begins to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  
        <h5>Step4</h5>
        Using the parchment paper, carefully lift the nachos from the air fryer 
        basket onto a serving platter. Top with sour cream, avocado, tomato,
        cilantro, and any additional toppings if desired. Serve immediately.

        <h1>Ingredients
        </h1>
        <ul>
           <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning, or seasoning blend of choice

            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste

            li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic

            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour

            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs

            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter

            <li>> tablespoons olive oil

            <li>8 garlic cloves, or more as needed, peeled and smashed, about 1/4 cup lightly packed

            <li>1 cup heavy cream

            <li>1 cup chicken broth

            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed (optional)</li>
            </ul>       
<h1>Directions
</h1>
<p>
    <h5>Step1</h5>
    Combine herb seasoning, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, and 
    flour in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag and mix well.
    <h5>Step2</h5>
    Combine butter and olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over 
    medium heat. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels, place in 
    the bag of seasoned flour, seal, and toss chicken thighs in the flour 
    mixture until evenly coated.
    <h5>Step3</h5>
    When butter stops sizzling, add chicken pieces and cook until 
    nicely browned, no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 
    4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near 
    the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a 
    plate and keep warm.
    <h5>Step4</h5>
    Add smashed garlic to the same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low 
    and cook garlic, stirring frequently, just until fragrant, no 
    longer than 1 minute.
