                <p>Many rabbits will teach themselves to use a litter 
                    box if one is available to them since they are very 
                    clean animals. Rabbits dislike living in their own mess, 
                    so most will pick a corner to do their business. By 
                    placing a litter box in this corner, rabbit owners can 
                    teach their rabbits to use the litter box even if it’s 
                    subsequently moved!

                    Have you ever seen a happy rabbit jump, twist, and leap 
                    into the air? This happy dancing is also known as 
                    “binkying,” and it’s done when the rabbit feels happy, 
                    comfortable, and safe in their surroundings. Rabbits 
                    often have big bursts of energy that accompany binkying. 
                    A binkying rabbit is a healthy and happy one, 
                    so just enjoy the show!

                    While the wild rabbits found in the US are all Cottontail 
                    rabbits (Sylvilagus Sp.), pet rabbits are a completely 
                    different species originating in Europe. Wild rabbits 
                    found across Europe are the descendants of domesticated 
                    rabbits and are the same species (the European Rabbit, 
                    Oryctolagus cuniculus). This means that all pet rabbits 
                    in the US are descended from European rabbits.
