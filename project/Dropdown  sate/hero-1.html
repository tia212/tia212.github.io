                    He mostly spent his days working alongside his owners. 
                    One of the best attributes, which this dog has managed to 
                    maintain, is his excellent disposition and usefulness.

                    They are very dynamic and intelligent. They can have a 
                    few genetic health problems but apart from that they enjoy 
                    very good health. To keep it in good health daily 
                    exercise would be necessary.

                    here dogs are the friendly dogs. They also like to hunt 
                    and catch. These are very fond of herding, and the 
                    protective instincts of these dogs are very strong. 
                    These dogs have a peaceful and alert nature.

                    Though awfully protective of their favorite people, 
                    pit bulls are quite friendly too. As a puppy, a pit bull 
                    wants to play all day, every day and loves interacting 
                    with children and adults alike.
