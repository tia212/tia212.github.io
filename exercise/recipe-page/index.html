        <h1> Pumpkin Churros</h1>
        <p>
            If fall could be wrapped up in a dessert, it would definitely 
            be these pumpkin-shaped churros. They’re crisp on the outside, 
            tender on the inside, and dusted in a cinnamon sugar mix with 
            a hint of pumpkin spice to really drive home that cozy fall 
            vibe. Whether you’re serving these at a gathering or just 
            enjoying them with a hot cup of coffee, these churros are 
   >         going to be a hit
    >    </p>

        <h1>Cinnamon Sugar Mixture</h1>
        <p>
            Before you start making the churro dough and frying, you’ll want 
            to make your cinnamon sugar mixture. It’s a simple blend of sugar, 
            cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. This mix is going to give the 
            churros that sweet, spiced coating reminiscent of pumpkin pie. 
            Make sure to set it aside so it’s ready for when your churros 
            come out of the fryer. You can adjust the level of spice 
            depending on how strong you want that pumpkin flavor to 
            be—go lighter for a more subtle touch, or add an extra 
            dash if you want it to really pop!
        </p>
        <h1>Churro Batter</h1>
        <p>
            The churro batter comes together on the stovetop and is 
            surprisingly easy. Start by heating water, sugar, vanilla, 
            pumpkin puree, butter, and a pinch of salt until it all comes 
            together in a smooth mixture. Once it’s boiling, you’ll stir 
            in the flour, making sure it’s fully combined. A rubber spatula 
            works best here—you want a smooth, lump-free dough. After cooking 
            the dough for a couple of minutes to dry it out slightly, let it 
            cool for a few minutes. This step is important because adding eggs 
            to a hot dough will scramble them, and we don’t want that!

            Once the dough has cooled a bit, you’ll mix in the eggs one at a time. 
            The dough should transform into something soft, elastic, and just a bit 
            sticky. If it feels too wet, you can let it sit for a few minutes to 
            firm up. A stand mixer makes this process quicker, but you can 
            definitely do it by hand with a rubber spatula if you’re up for it!
        <br>
        </br>
        <b>TIP:</b> For even more flavor, brown the butter first and then add 
            the water, sugar, vanilla, pumpkin puree, and a pinch of salt. 
            This adds a delicious nutty flavor!
        </p>
        <h1>Piping the Pumpkins</h1>
        <p>
            Now for the fun part—shaping the churros! You’ll need a piping 
            bag fitted with a star tip to create that iconic churro texture. 
            Pipe out your pumpkins onto small squares of parchment paper. 
            Make sure the dough is thick enough to hold its shape but not 
            too thick to pipe smoothly. If the “stems” don’t look quite right, 
            you can snip them off with scissors before frying. It’s helpful 
            to have all your churros piped out before you start frying to 
            keep things moving quickly.
        
            You can find the piping tip at a store like Michaels or purchase 
            it online from Amazon here. Also, if piping the pumpkin shape turns 
            out too difficult you can just pipe it into a typical churro shape 
            right into the hot oil!
        </p>
        <h1>Frying Tips
        </h1>
        <p>
            Getting the oil temperature right is crucial for perfect churros. 
            You want it hot enough to give the churros that golden brown 
            crunch, but not too hot! If the oil is too hot, the churros will 
            brown quickly on the outside but stay raw on the inside. Aim for 
            an even temperature and fry them in small batches—this helps ensure 
            each churro cooks through evenly. Be sure to flip them halfway 
            through so they get golden brown on both sides. Once they’re fried 
            to perfection, transfer the churros to a paper towel to drain excess 
            oil. You’ll want to fry them for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side 
            to ensure they’re fully cooked.

        <br>
        </br>
        <b>PRO TIP:</b> Keep an eye on your oil temperature between batches. 
        If it cools down too much, the churros will absorb more oil, and 
        no one wants greasy churros!

                    <h2>Test Kitchen Tips</h2>
            <p>
                        “If you’re looking for that perfect, easy, nostalgic, 
                        and delicious treat, make these peanut butter 
                        cookies — fork marks and all,” says culinary developer 
                        Nicole McLaughlin <b>(a.k.a. NicoleMcMom)</B>. Here are some 
                        expert tips from Nicole: 

            <ul>
                        <li>Don’t forget to chill the cookie dough before 
                        rolling it into balls, as cookies have a tendency 
                        to spread in the oven and chilling makes the dough 
                        easier to work with.</li>
                        <li>Don’t skip the criss-cross step! The fork 
                        marks give these cookies a nostalgic appearance, 
                        but they also serve a purpose: The marks help the 
                        cookies bake evenly.</li> 
                       <li> “A lot of people complain about peanut butter 
                        cookies becoming crumbly,” Nicole says.                            
                        “The main reason for that is that they’re 
                        overcooked.” Check the cookies at the 7-8 minute 
                        mark to make sure they’re perfectly baked.</li>
