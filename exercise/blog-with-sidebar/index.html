              <b>What is buldak?</b>
              <br></br>

                Buldak, aka fire chicken, is a spicy barbecued Korean chicken 
                dish. ‚ÄúBul‚Äù means fire and ‚Äúdak‚Äù means chicken. Buldak is bite 
                sized pieces of chicken doused in a spicy sauce made with 
                gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, jocheong (rice syrup), garlic, 
                and ginger. It‚Äôs a pretty new dish that became popular in the 
                early 2000s both in part to buldak restaurants and Samyang 
                buldak instant noodles.

                <b>What is buldak ramen?</b>
                <br></br>
                Buldak ramen, made famous by popular Korean brand Samyang are 
                SUPER spicy instant ramen noodles. They‚Äôre called buldak 
                bokkeum myeon or hot chicken flavor ramen and essentially 
                they‚Äôre instant ramen that are buldak flavored. They are one 
                of the spiciest instant noodles available in the world and 
                there are several different flavors. Unlike most instant ramens 
                that are soupy, buldak ramen is a sauced noodle: after the 
                noodles are cooked, they‚Äôre drained and mixed with the buldak 
                sauce. The noodles are incredibly popular and Samyangs best 
                selling noodle.

                <b>Do you love spicy things? If so, you probably love buldak, 
                and you‚Äôll probably love this homemade buldak ramen too.</b> 
                <br></br>
                It‚Äôs fiery hot, spicy red, and so, so good. It‚Äôs one of my 
                favorite things at Korean restaurants even though it‚Äôs so 
                spicy I can‚Äôt handle. It‚Äôs also super popular for Korean BBQ. 
                I especially love it with cheese!

            <b>How to make buldak ramen</b>
            <br></br>

                Mix up the sauce. In the bowl you want to eat your noodles in, 
                mix up 1 tbsp gochujang, 1 tbsp gochugaru, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 
                2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp chicken bullion powder, 1 clove garlic, 
                and 1/4 tsp black pepper.
                Cook the noodles. Cook the noodles according to the package.
                Toss the noodles in sauce. When the noodles are ready, pull 
                them directly from the pot into the bowl with the sauce. Toss 
                until all the noodles are glossy and saucy, loosening with 
                noodle water if needed and get your spice on ü•µ
                Enjoy.

              <b>How spicy is buldak?</b>
              <br></br>
              It‚Äôs pretty darn spicy! Every one‚Äôs spice tolerance is different 
              but I will say that the spice of buldak is one that builds and 
              builds. The nice thing about making it homemade is that you get 
              all of the flavor with only as much spice as you like
