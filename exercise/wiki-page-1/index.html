            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also
            <i> canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i> canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or
             <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3])</sup>
              is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
              in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
              not touch each other, forming a canopy with
              channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5] </sup>The 
              phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
              the same species, but also occurs between trees
              of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many 
              hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive
              behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit
               spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
