            (/ˈrɑːmən/) (拉麺, ラーメン or らあめん, rāmen, [ɾaꜜːmeɴ]
            ⓘ) is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat 
            noodles (中華麺, chūkamen) served in a broth. Common flavors are 
            soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork 
            (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and 
            scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes and is a 
            part of Japanese Chinese cuisine.[1] Nearly every region in Japan 
            has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone 
            broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.

            The origins of ramen can be traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in 
            the early 20th century. The word "ramen" is a Japanese borrowing 
            of the Chinese word lamian (拉麵), meaning "pulled noodles", but 
            is not derived from the northern Chinese dish of lamian. Instead, 
            the dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes from regions 
            such as Guangzhou, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers 
            in Yokohama. Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during
            food shortages following World War II. In 1958, instant noodles 
            were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish.
            <br></br>
            Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional 
            varieties and a wide range of toppings. Examples include Sapporo's 
            rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, 
            flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with 
            soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Iekei Ramen with soy 
            flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy sauce and pork bone broth, 
            and Hakata's milky tonkotsu (pork bone) broth. Ramen is offered in 
            various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually 
            found in specialist ramen shops called ramenya (ラーメン屋).

            <hr>

        Ramen's popularity has spread outside of Japan. In Korea, ramen is 
        also known as its original name (라멘), having their own variation of
        the dish, ramyeon (라면). In China, ramen is called rìshì lāmiàn 
        (日式拉面/日式拉麵 "Japanese-style lamian"). Ramen has also made its way 
        into Western restaurant chains. Instant ramen was exported from Japan in
        1971 and has since gained international recognition.

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
            The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese 
            lamian (拉麵, 'pulled noodles').[2][3]
            <br></br>

            The word ramen (拉麺) first appeared in Japan in Seiichi Yoshida's 
            How to Prepare Delicious and Economical Chinese Dishes (1928).[4] 
            In the book, Yoshida describes how to make ramen using flour and 
            kansui, kneading it by hand, and stretching it with an illustration.
            He also states that ramen is better suited for soup or cold 
            noodles than for baked noodles. In this case, however, ramen refers 
            to Chinese noodles, not the dish. The first mention of ramen as a 
            dish appears in Hatsuko Kuroda's Enjoyable Home Cooking (1947).[5]
            <br></br>
            Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as 
            Nankin soba (南京そば, lit. 'Nanjing noodles'), Shina soba (支那そば,
            lit. 'Chinese noodles') or Chūka soba (中華そば, lit. 'Chinese 
            noodles').[6][7][8] For example, in 1903, in Yokohama Chinatown 
            (then known as Nanjing Town), there was a Nanjing noodle restaurant 
            (南京蕎麦所, Nankin soba dokoro).[9]
            <br></br>
            Until the 1950s, ramen was most commonly called Shina soba, but 
            today Chūka soba or just ramen (ラーメン) are more common, as the 
            word 支那 (Shina, meaning 'China') has acquired a pejorative 
            connotation through its association with anti-Chinese racism and 
            Japanese imperialism.[10]

            <B>Noodles</b>

            Fresh ramen noodles
            The type of noodles used in ramen are called chūkamen 
            (中華麺, lit. 'Chinese noodles'), which are derived from 
            traditional Chinese alkaline noodles known as jiǎnshuǐ miàn 
            (鹼水麵). Most chūkamen are made from four basic ingredients: 
            wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui [ja], derived from the 
            Chinese jiǎnshuǐ (鹼水), a type of alkaline mineral water 
            containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, 
            as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Ramen 
            is not to be confused with different kinds of noodle such as soba,
            udon, or somen
